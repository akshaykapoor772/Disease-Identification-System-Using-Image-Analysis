# Deployment-Deep-Learning-Model

This project a major step towards accurately identifying various anomalies in health conditions digitally. It can be readily available for hospitals and its working staff to analyze the pathological trends using digital images of patients. One can upload the image and our model will capture the RGB pattern from it, based on which relevant outcome will be projected.


Objectives that we achieved during this project are:

1. Establish the specification and design the optical face image acquisition system
2. Design and develop the image parameter extractions system
3. Create the data pipeline on Azure ML
4. Train the models for health conditions specific anomaly detection
5. Build and deploy the API for Image Analytics


Outcomes of this project are as follows:

1. Produce a new model that can generate insights into detecting ailment at an early stage
2. Methodologies and tools facilitating the take up of technological innovation in order to help patients and doctors effectively
3. Benefit with reduced cost and accurate identification
4. An advancement in existing models will fill a gap in knowledge and lay a base for the application of specific methods to large scale in the healthcare sector

The model cannot be uploaded to GitHub because of the size limitations. Here is the drive link to the trained model which should be put into the project directory before running the app.py file. Drive link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GNx51_CUvXtMRv7RzPob6YbM86vMtwk6/view?usp=sharing
